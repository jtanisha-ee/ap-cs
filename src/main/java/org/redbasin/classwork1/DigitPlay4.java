           Inside the while loop we do a modulus to give us the remainder
           For instance 723%10 is 3 which gives us first digit
           723/10 = 72
           72%10 = 2 which gives us the second digit
           723/100 = 7
           7%10 = 7 which gives us the third digit
           723/1000 = 0, and we stop the while loop here
           At each step we compute the sum from the digit extracted.
