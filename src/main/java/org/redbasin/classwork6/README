Digit Words
===========
The digit words program takes a digit spelled in letters and
returns back the corresponding digit. For instance, if you
enter two, it will return 2, and  if you enter three, it will return 3.
Exercise 1
==========
Please implement the for loop. Compile and run the program
to test if it works.
Exercise 2
==========
Currently, if you enter any invalid string, it just prints 0. Modify
the program so that instead of returning 0, it will print:
"You have entered an invalid string."
Exercise 3
==========
Write a new program, WordDigits.java that does the reverse.
So if you enter 1, it should print 1, or if you enter five, it should
print 5, and so on. Make it working for digits 0-9.
