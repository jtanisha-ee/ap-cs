Develop a Rectangle class that takes as input the 4 co-ordinates:
NW: (x1, y1)
NE: (x2, y2)
SW: (x3, y3)
SE: (x4, y4)
It should return getArea() and getPerimeter() as double. The formula for distance is
Math.sqrt(Math.pow(y2-y1, 2) + Math.pow(x2-x1, 2))
Test your class with this example:
NW: (4, 7)
NE: (9, 7)
SW: (4, 1)
SE: (9, 1)
